# API-Based ETL Pipeline (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python.
The pipeline fetches data from external REST APIs, transforms raw JSON into analytics-ready
tables, and loads the processed data into a relational database for reporting and analysis.

This project simulates a real-world data engineering workflow commonly used in analytics
and business intelligence environments.
